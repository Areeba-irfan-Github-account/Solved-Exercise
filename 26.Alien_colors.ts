//Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'

// Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
  
// let alien_color = "green"
//  if (alien_color == "green")
//    console.log("You earned 5 points for shooting the alien.")

 //• Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
//  let alien_color = "pink"
// if (alien_color != "Black"){
//   console.log("You earned 10 points.")

//• Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block
